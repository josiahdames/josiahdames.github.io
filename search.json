    "text": "When you think of the modern NFL, what players do you think of? Most of the time, people think of elite quarterbacks or wide receivers or running backs. The names range from Patrick Mahomes to Justin Jefferson to Derrick Henry.\nHowever, there was an issue brewing recently that sparked controversy in the NFL: Running backs weren’t being paid as well as they should. Running backs like Johnathan Taylor and Josh Jacobs were having contract issues throughout 2023. There were even kickers that were out earning running backs.\nThis begs some questions: Is the position of running back dying in the NFL? Is the NFL focusing on the passing game? Let’s look at the last two decades, 2001-2010 and 2011-2020. With the exception of the 2001 season, each season had 32 teams playing. This was also before the NFL officially moved to a 17-game regular season.\nThe Pro Football Reference shows the NFL’s history of offense, both on the ground and in the air.\nFirst, we will ask the question: Is the passing game giving the run game a chance to flourish in the NFL?\nWe will divide each year’s receiving yards by rushing yards to create a factor called “Net Yards.” This indicates that for every one rushing yard, there is a number of receiving yards to that one rushing yard. The bigger the “Net Yards,” the bigger the difference between receiving and rushing yards.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(readr)\n\npassing_rushing_totals_sports_reference &lt;- read_csv(\"passing_rushing_totals_sports_reference.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 93 Columns: 15\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (15): Rank, Year, Tms, RushingAttempts, RushingYards, RushingTD, Rushing...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\nnfl &lt;- passing_rushing_totals_sports_reference |&gt; \n  filter(Year &gt;= 2001 & Year &lt;=2020) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    NetYards = ReceivingYards/RushingYards\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=nfl, \n    aes(x=RushingYards, y=ReceivingYards, size=NetYards),\n    alpha = 0.3) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2,8), name = \"NetYards\") +\ngeom_point(\n    data = nfl, \n    aes(\n      x = RushingYards, \n      y = ReceivingYards, \n      size = NetYards),\n    alpha = .3,\n    color = \"black\") +\ngeom_text_repel(\n    data=nfl, \n    aes(x=RushingYards, y=ReceivingYards, label=Year)) +\ngeom_vline(xintercept = 58189.71) +\ngeom_hline(yintercept = 121042.3) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Rushing Yards\", y = \"Receiving Yards\",\n    title = \"The NFL lacks consistency on the run game\",\n    subtitle = \"The 2010s emphasized offense in the air more than the 2000s, especially in the mid-2010s.\",\n    caption = \"By: Josiah Dames | Source: [Pro Football Reference] (https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/NFL/rushing.html)\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 60250, y = 122000),\n    label = \"A Season's Rushing Yards\",\n    size = 3,\n    color = \"dark grey\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 58195, y = 140000),\n    label = \"A Season's Passing Yards\",\n    size = 3,\n    color = \"dark grey\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 57000, y = 135000),\n    label = \"Huge emphasis on passing offense\",\n    size = 3\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 60000, y = 100000),\n    label = \"Huge emphasis on offense on the ground\",\n    size = 3\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nnfl |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    RushMean = mean(RushingYards),\n    ReceiveingMean = mean(ReceivingYards)\n  )\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  RushMean ReceiveingMean\n     &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1   58308.        121588.\n\n\nAs we look at the two decades of football, the 2000s show that they emphasize the run game a lot more and there isn’t much difference between the yards in the air or on the ground.
