    "title": "Is the NFL a passing league or a rushing league?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "When you think of the modern NFL, what players do you think of? Most of the time, people think of elite quarterbacks, wide receivers or running backs- names like Patrick Mahomes, Justin Jefferson and Derrick Henry.\nHowever, there was a controversy brewing recently in the NFL: running backs’ earnings weren’t keeping up with their teammates. Players like Johnathan Taylor and Josh Jacobs had contract issues throughout 2023. Even kickers were out earning running backs.\nThis begs the question: Is the position of running back dying because the NFL is too focused on the passing game? Let’s look at the last two decades, 2001-2010 and 2011-2020. With the exception of the 2001 season, each season had 32 teams playing in a 16-game regular season.\nThe Pro Football Reference’s “Rushing & Receiving League Totals” statistics show the NFL’s history of offense, both on the ground and in the air.\nFirst, we will answer the question: Is the passing game giving the running game a chance to flourish in the NFL?\nWe will divide each year’s receiving yards by rushing yards to create a factor called “Net Yards.” This indicates that for every one rushing yard, there is a specific number of receiving yards. The bigger the “Net Yards,” the bigger the difference between receiving and rushing yards.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\npassing_rushing_totals_sports_reference &lt;- read_csv(\"passing_rushing_totals_sports_reference.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nnflyards &lt;- passing_rushing_totals_sports_reference |&gt; \n  filter(Year &gt;= 2001 & Year &lt;=2020) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    NetYards = ReceivingYards/RushingYards\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=nflyards, \n    aes(x=RushingYards, y=ReceivingYards, size=NetYards),\n    alpha = 0.3) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2,8), name = \"Net Yards\") +\ngeom_point(\n    data = nflyards, \n    aes(\n      x = RushingYards, \n      y = ReceivingYards, \n      size = NetYards),\n    alpha = .3,\n    color = \"black\") +\ngeom_text_repel(\n    data=nflyards, \n    aes(x=RushingYards, y=ReceivingYards, label=Year)) +\ngeom_vline(xintercept = 58189.71) +\ngeom_hline(yintercept = 121042.3) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Rushing Yards\", y = \"Receiving Yards\",\n    title = \"NFL offenses lack consistency on the run game\",\n    subtitle = \"2020 was probably the most balanced year between both offenses ever.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Josiah Dames\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 60250, y = 122000),\n    label = \"A Season's Rushing Yards\",\n    size = 3,\n    color = \"#d50a0a\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 58195, y = 140000),\n    label = \"A Season's Passing Yards\",\n    size = 3,\n    color = \"#d50a0a\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 57000, y = 135000),\n    label = \"Huge emphasis on passing offense\",\n    size = 3,\n    color = \"#013369\",\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 59500, y = 103000),\n    label = \"Huge emphasis on rushing offense\",\n    size = 3, \n    color = \"#013369\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nnflyards |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    RushMean = mean(RushingYards),\n    ReceiveingMean = mean(ReceivingYards)\n  )\n\n\nAs we look at the two decades of football, the 2000s show that the running game was emphasized a lot more and there isn’t much difference between the yards in the air or on the ground. In the 2010s, however, the rushing yards were inconsistent.\nAccording to Fox Sports, the 2010s offense prioritized passing. This can be proven by many teams’ offensive statistics. The top six offenses of the last decade were the 2011 New Orleans Saints, 2011 Green Bay Packers, 2013 Denver Broncos, 2016 Atlanta Falcons, 2018 Kansas City Chiefs, and 2019 Baltimore Ravens. By itself, the Falcons’ Super Bowl LI run in 2016 had quarterback Matt Ryan throwing for almost 5,000 yards and 38 touchdowns in the regular season. That Falcons’ offense had the highest grade offense in the 2010s at 94.1. That is very impressive.\nThis leads to the next question: how much did the rushing and passing game change by year? In order to see the dip in rushing and rise in passing offense, we need to see each year side by side.\nThe 2000s will be colored Rosso Corsa and the 2010s will be colored Dark Midnight Blue.\n\n\nCode\ndecadeone &lt;- nflyards |&gt;\n  filter(Year &gt;= 2001 & Year &lt;= 2010)\n\ndecadetwo &lt;- nflyards |&gt;\n  filter(Year &gt;= 2011 & Year &lt;= 2020)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=nflyards, aes(x=Year, y=ReceivingYards), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_line(data=decadeone, aes(x=Year, y=ReceivingYards), color=\"#d50a0a\") +\n  geom_line(data=decadetwo, aes(x=Year, y=ReceivingYards), color=\"#013369\") +\n  labs(\n    y = \"Receiving Yards\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    fill = \"Receiving Yards\",\n    title = \"The passing game consistently grew in the last\\ntwo decades\",\n    subtitle = \"Its efficiency dropped in 2017 but improved over the next few years.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Josiah Dames\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2001:2020)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, margin=margin(t=1)),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=10, angle=90),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe love our big pass plays, they are exciting to watch. Is the NFL trying to push for this kind of offense, just so it can get more clicks for crazy highlights by wide receivers? Maybe, but maybe there is something else to this.\nLet’s look at the run game throughout the last two decades.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=nflyards, aes(x=Year, y=RushingYards), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_line(data=decadeone, aes(x=Year, y=RushingYards), color=\"#d50a0a\") +\n  geom_line(data=decadetwo, aes(x=Year, y=RushingYards), color=\"#013369\") +\n  labs(\n    y = \"Rushing Yards\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    fill = \"Rushing Yards\",\n    title = \"The NFL didn't prioritize the running game in the 2010s\",\n    subtitle = \"Its production in the mid-2010s hadn't been that low since 2001.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Josiah Dames\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2001:2020)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=10, angle=90),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you were a running back in the mid-2010s, you were not getting enough love. Luckily, it looks like the trend for the rushing game is slowly increasing. Fortunately, there is an explanation for this.\nNFL Football Operations explains that in recent seasons, the passing yards per game has slowly dropped from 496 in 2020 to 403 in 2024. This means that defenses across the league have slowly adjusted to the passing game. Defenses have embraced Cover 2, Cover 4, and Cover 6, and defenders are lining up farther back than in 2019. If this trend continues, maybe the NFL will switch back to be a more dominant rushing league.\nHowever, trends are hard to predict. One year, the passing game could be top priority and then the next year, it’s the running game. This begs the question: where does each year rank individually with their rushing and receiving yards?\nThe receiving yards will be colored Rosso Corsa and the rushing yards will be colored Dark Midnight Blue.\n\n\nCode\nseasontotals &lt;- passing_rushing_totals_sports_reference |&gt; \n  group_by(Year) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    SeasonRushingYards = sum(RushingYards),\n    SeasonReceivingYards = sum(ReceivingYards),\n    TotalOffensiveYards = SeasonRushingYards + SeasonReceivingYards,\n    .groups = 'drop'\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter(Year &gt;= 2001 & Year &lt;=2020)\n\nseasontotalslong &lt;- seasontotals |&gt; \n  select(-TotalOffensiveYards) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = ends_with(\"Yards\"),\n    names_to = \"metric\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=seasontotalslong, aes(x=reorder(Year, value), weight=value, fill=metric), color = \"black\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#d50a0a\", \"#013369\")) +\n  coord_flip() +\nlabs(\n    y = \"Season Yards\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    fill = \"Season Yards\",\n    title = \"Receiving yards dominate the 2010s compared to the 2000s\",\n    subtitle = \"Regardless of how stagnant the run game, the NFL tried throwing the ball more.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Josiah Dames\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, the passing game dominates in the 2010s. According all of the previous graphs, 2020 has the most rushing yards and one of the top spots in receiving yards. But what about its offensive efficiency? Surely the year with the most yards has the most yards per attempt rate on both sides of offense.\n\n\nCode\nseasonattempts &lt;- passing_rushing_totals_sports_reference |&gt; \n  group_by(Year) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    SeasonRushingYardsPerAttempt = RushingYards/RushingAttempts,\n    SeasonReceivingYardsPerAttempt = ReceivingYards/ReceivingReceptions,\n    TotalOffensiveYards = SeasonRushingYardsPerAttempt + SeasonReceivingYardsPerAttempt,\n    .groups = 'drop'\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter(Year &gt;= 2001 & Year &lt;= 2020)\n\nseasonattemptslong &lt;- seasonattempts |&gt; \n  select(-TotalOffensiveYards) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = ends_with(\"Attempt\"),\n    names_to = \"metric\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=seasonattemptslong, aes(x=reorder(Year, value), weight=value, fill=metric), color = \"black\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#d50a0a\", \"#013369\")) +\n  coord_flip()  +\nlabs(\n    y = \"Yards Per Attempt\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    fill = \"Yards Per Attempt\",\n    title = \"2011 was the most efficient year for the passing game\",\n    subtitle = \"While 2020 had the most yards, 2011 had the most yards per attempt.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Josiah Dames\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma, breaks=c(1:15)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf 2011 is the most effective year for the pass game, it could be argued that former Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers and the 2011 Packers could be one of-if not the most-efficient offenses in all of NFL history. However, the number of attempts do not determine the number of passing or rushing yards.\nOne thing is for certain: nothing is ever consistent. Eventually, the defense will figure it out, and then it’s back to the drawing board."

    "text": "The 1972 Dolphins are the only team in NFL history to go undefeated and win the Super Bowl the same year. Led by quarterback Bob Griese and head coach Don Shula, the Dolphins did the impossible and no one has even been close to breaking that record, with the exception of the 2007 New England Patriots.\nWhile the ’72 Dolphins were regarded as one of the best teams in NFL history, that doesn’t always mean that they were the “best” team statistically. There are some teams, like the 1985 Chicago Bears, who didn’t have a great offense but were carried by the defense.\nIf the ’72 Dolphins were that good, how do they compared with other great teams in NFL history? The league has changed a lot in the last 50 years. But before we answer that question, what about the other ’72 teams?\nThe Pro Football Reference’s “Team Offense” statistics show each seasons’s offense, including yards, completions, yards per play, and points.\nTo determine if the ’72 Dolphins were a great team, we must look at if they are even the best team that year statistically.
